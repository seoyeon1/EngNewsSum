Once a centerpiece of international diplomacy, there have been no serious peace talks since the Obama administration.President Donald J. Trump sidelined the Palestinian conflict, and persuaded four Arab governments to normalize relations with Israel, shattering decades of Arab consensus that resolving the Palestinian conflict and ending the occupation had to come first.For weeks, ethnic tensions had been rising in Jerusalem, the center of the conflict. In April, far-right Jews marched through the city center, chanting “Death to Arabs,” and mobs of both Jews and Arabs attacked each other.Palestinian anger increased as a deadline to expel several families from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem, approached — a case that quickly became a stand-in for historic expulsions of Palestinians from land in Israel.The situation finally boiled over after a police raid on one of Islam’s holiest sites, the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, on Monday, which the police said was in response to stone-throwing by Palestinian demonstrators.Hamas launched long-range rockets at Jerusalem on Monday evening, prompting Israel to respond with airstrikes. The military conflict also unleashed a wave of protests and rioting in Arab areas across Israel that night.As the violence escalated, diplomats around the world called for both sides to end the fighting.Speaking to reporters, President Joseph R. Biden said that he had spoken “for a while” to Mr. Netanyahu on Wednesday and said his expectation was that tensions would be “closing down sooner rather than later.” Mr. Biden added that “Israel has a right to defend itself, when you have thousands of rockets flying into your territory.”Officials in several Arab countries, including some that had normalized relations with Israel, criticized its actions. Saudi Arabia, which has not normalized relations with Israel, condemned “in the strongest terms the blatant attacks carried out by the Israeli occupation forces against the sanctity of the Al Aqsa Mosque.”In Kuwait and Istanbul, there were protests on Tuesday night.While the immediate triggers for the Palestinian rioting were the Aqsa mosque, the Sheikh Jarrah case and the Gaza conflict, the riots also gave vent to years of pent-up anger from Israel’s Arab minority, which represents about 20 percent of the population.They have full citizenship and many have become lawmakers, judges and senior civil servants. But rights advocates say they are nevertheless victims of dozens of discriminatory laws, not least a recent law that downgraded the status of the Arabic language and said that only Jews had the right to determine the nature of the Israeli state.“The way that we are treated is as though we shouldn’t be here,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian political analyst from Haifa, a northern city in Israel, and a former legal adviser to the Palestine Liberation Organization. “We are the people who they mistakenly did not ethnically cleanse from this place.”In the central city of Lod, the government declared a state of emergency early Wednesday after a synagogue, school and several vehicles were burned by Arab rioters on Monday and Tuesday nights.A Palestinian citizen, Moussa Hassouna, was shot dead by a Jewish resident during the disturbances on Monday night, and another wave of unrest followed his funeral 24 hours later.The Israeli police said that Arab mobs were pulling Jews from their homes and trying to kill them.“I feel like it’s 100 years ago, and I’m a defenseless Jew in the pogroms,” said Shabtai Pessin, 27, standing in a burned-out classroom at a religious school in Lod. “What’s our sin? Wanting a Jewish state after 2000 years of exile?”In the northern city of Acre, a popular Jewish fish restaurant was set on fire, while Arab Bedouins attacked police stations and passing cars in the Negev desert, in southern Israel.On Wednesday, these riots prompted crowds of Jews to respond. Video distributed on Wednesday night showed mobs attempting to break into an Arab family’s apartment; smashing the windows of shops they believed to be Arab-owned; and setting up roadblocks to catch Arab drivers.In Lod, Arab families feared revenge attacks that summoned up memories of past traumas. Thousands of Palestinians fled their homes there in 1948, never to return.“I still feel unsure whether I can keep living here,” said Maha Nakib, 50, an administrator and former City Council member in Lod. “I fear they will try to expel us from our homes.”In the cities of Or Akiva and Beersheva, Jews stoned the cars of people they believed to be Arab. In Tiberias, they threw rocks at hotels housing Arabs, who hurled objects from their windows in return. Cars were set on fire in several towns.And an Arab mob in Acre ransacked a Jewish-owned hotel.“It’s happening as we speak,” the hotel’s owner, Evan Fallenberg, said by phone on Wednesday night.“People are saying this is a rupture that we won’t be able to overcome. I don’t believe that — I know my friendships are lasting ones. But it is going to put everything to the test. We’re headed into something extremely difficult and dangerous, and I don’t know where this is going to end or how.”'"
